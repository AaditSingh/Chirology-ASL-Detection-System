# 🖐️ Sign Language Recognition System

![Sign Language Recognition](https://github.com/AaditSingh/Sign-Language-Recognition-System/blob/6bb7ed21b8499b042e8cebb9a16fc7a5d05fbb56/asl_sign.png)

## 📚 Project Overview

Sign Language Recognition System aims to bridge the communication gap between speech-impaired or deaf individuals and those who do not understand sign language. This system recognizes hand signs and gestures, converting them into readable text to facilitate communication.

## 🎯 Motivation

According to the 2011 Indian census, roughly 1.3 million people have hearing impairments, with the National Association of the Deaf estimating this number to be around 18 million. This significant number of individuals highlights the need for a system that can help them communicate effectively with those who do not understand sign language.

## ✨ Features

- **Sign Language Interpreter/Translator:** Facilitates communication between deaf-dumb and normal individuals without needing a human translator.
- **Sign Language Learning Tool:** Assists in teaching sign language to deaf-dumb children.
- **Human-Computer Interface:** Allows deaf-dumb individuals to interact with computer systems.
- **Interfacing in Virtual Environment:** Uses gestures to control various systems, including computers, music systems, virtual games, home appliances, and medical equipment.

## 📊 Dataset

We are using the “Sign Language MNIST” dataset, a public-domain, free-to-use dataset available on [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/datamunge/sign-language-mnist). This dataset contains pixel information for around 1,000 images of each of 24 ASL letters, excluding J and Z.

## 🚧 Challenges

- **Real-Time Recognition:** The system needs to work in uncontrolled real-time environments, coping with messy backgrounds, moving objects, diverse lighting conditions, and various users.
- **Indian Sign Language Dataset:** There's a lack of standard datasets for Indian Sign Language (ISL) and issues with standardization.
- **Dynamic Gestures:** Recognizing dynamic hand gestures and differentiating between gestures with similar meanings remains challenging.
- **False Gestures:** Detecting false gestures, such as unwanted gestures between words in a sentence, is still a challenge.
- **Two-Hand Gestures:** Many ISL alphabets use two hands, making recognition difficult.

## 🏛️ System Architecture

### 1. Data Acquisition
- **Dataset:** Sign Language MNIST dataset from [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/datamunge/sign-language-mnist)
- **Format:** CSV file containing pixel information for images of ASL letters

### 2. Preprocessing
- **Image Processing:**
  - Resize images to the required input shape for the neural network
  - Normalize pixel values
  - Data augmentation using `ImageDataGenerator` to enhance training

### 3. Model Architecture
- **Sequential Model:** Using Keras
  - **Convolutional Layers:** To extract features from images
    ```python
    model.add(Conv2D(filters=32, kernel_size=(3,3), activation='relu', input_shape=(28,28,1)))
    model.add(MaxPool2D(pool_size=(2,2)))
    model.add(BatchNormalization())
    ```
  - **Fully Connected Layers:** For classification
    ```python
    model.add(Flatten())
    model.add(Dense(128, activation='relu'))
    model.add(Dropout(0.5))
    model.add(Dense(24, activation='softmax'))  # 24 classes for ASL letters
    ```
  - **Optimization and Compilation:**
    ```python
    model.compile(optimizer='adam', loss='categorical_crossentropy', metrics=['accuracy'])
    ```

### 4. Training
- **Callbacks:** Use `ReduceLROnPlateau` to adjust learning rate during training
- **Training the Model:** Fit the model on the training data using the preprocessed and augmented images

### 5. Prediction
- **Model Inference:**
  - Load the pre-trained model using `load_model()`
  - Preprocess input images in real-time using OpenCV and Mediapipe for hand tracking
  - Predict the sign language gesture
    ```python
    model = load_model('path_to_model.h5')
    predictions = model.predict(processed_image)
    ```

### 6. Output
- **Text-to-Speech:** Convert recognized text to speech using `gTTS`
  ```python
  tts = gTTS(text=recognized_text, lang='en')
  tts.save('output.mp3')
  os.system('mpg321 output.mp3')
  ```

### 7. User Interface
- **Real-Time Recognition:** Use OpenCV to capture video frames and process them
- **Hand Tracking:** Use Mediapipe to detect hand landmarks and extract the region of interest
- **Display:** Show the recognized sign and corresponding text on the screen

### 8. Environment Setup
- **Suppress TensorFlow Warnings:**
  ```python
  os.environ['TF_CPP_MIN_LOG_LEVEL'] = '3'
  ```
